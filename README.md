## Project task
Project task was to build an expenses tracker web application following the tutorial ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ&feature=emb_imp_woyt)) using Context API.

## Project overview
Got a bit more familiar with Context API, what it is and what it does. Sharpend up my React skills a bit while coding along the tutorial.
